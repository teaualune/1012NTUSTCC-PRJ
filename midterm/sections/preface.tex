\label{ch1}

This report summarizes the collective results on the project so far.
It includes the original project description, survey results on several open source projects and web-related techniques that are useful in the project, roadmaps for implementation, and some possible issues for the project.

While the report is aimed to become a milestone of works done in the midterm, most parts of this report will reappear in the final project report.
