\subsection{System Overview}

The system is combined with serveral parts:

\begin{enumerate}

\item[(I)] the master server

\item[(II)] the client browsers

\end{enumerate}

For (I) we use node.js as its basic infrastructure.

For (II) the browsers first retrieve contents from the server, and then use the javascript in the content to establish the connection via Socket.io; thus it can wait for incoming tasks.
