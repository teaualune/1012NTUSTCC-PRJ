\subsection{Part II: Browser Clients}

After recieving web content from the server (or, with another word, the user visits the website hosted on the server) the client is registered to the server to wait for coming tasks; the register action builds Socket.io connection betweent the browser and the server.

When the browser recieves the split data, map function and reduce function, it starts to execute mapper function where split data is the input. Upon receiving, the mapper and reducer functions are just plain strings, but javascript provide convenient ways to translate them back to executable functions.

After the mapper terminates it produces an javascript object containing many key-value pairs and upload those intermediate data to the server.

The reduce function is executed while the client receives the \emph{REDUCE} message. The message will hold key-value pairs as message body. The reduced output is stored by the client.

When the browser recieves the \emph{MAP\_ALL\_END} signal, it then starts to upload the final result after all reducers are executed.
