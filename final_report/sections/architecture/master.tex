\subsection{Master Server}

The master server does two major works:

(1) provide web content delievered to browsers, and

(2) control the whole MapReduce algorithm process.

We discuss them separately.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Web Content Delievering\\
The node.js server creates a HTTP server object and listens for HTTP GET requests for root path.
Upon recieving requests, the HTTP server object sends web content back via HTTP response.

The web content contains the following parts:
\begin{itemize}

\item HTML content: a webpage that allows user to register to server.

\item Browser-side javascript program: the main component that executes MapReduce related works.

\item Other assets files.

\end{itemize}
Details of the HTML content and browser-side javascript program will be discussed in the next section.

There is another webpage on /master path that plays as a role of MapReduce algorithm trigger.

\item MapReduce Algorithm Process Control\\
The server begins the algorithm by firstly dispatches split data, map function and reduce function to registered clients.

Due to the non-blocking I/O and event-driven characteristic of Node.js, the following processes are not execute after the data are dispatched; instead, we let the server listens to several messages that each represents a part of the algorithm, such as \emph{MAPDATA} (in order to receive mapper output), \emph{REDUCEDATA}, etc. The messages are treated as APIs and will be discussed later.

\end{enumerate}
