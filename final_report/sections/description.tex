\section{Project Description}

The project implements a basic structure of the MapReduce programming model. The master server is written in Node.js with Express framework, which helps faster developing on Node.js; the webpage delievered by the server is treated as the client nodes. The core of the mapReduce algorithm, altogether with utilities like input reader and output writer, are written as a Node.js module that is used by Express.

To register as a computing node, clients visit the site hosted by the server and a socket connection will be established. The client then becomes a node a waits for incoming requests.

To start the MapReduce program, administrators visit another master page on the server and click the Start button on the page. The server will then start to read input, dispatch tasks and wait for result and write to output directory.

Different with the traditional MapReduce model, we canâ€™t directly communicate between browsers, so the the intermediate result done by map workers will be sent to the server fist, and then shuffle these intermediate results to the reducers.
