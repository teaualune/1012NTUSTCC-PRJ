\subsection{System Overview}

The system is combined with serveral parts:

\begin{enumerate}

\item[(I)] the master server

\item[(II)] the client browsers

%\item[(III)] the client servers

\end{enumerate}

%For both (I) and (III) we use node.js as its basic infrastructure.
For (I) we use node.js as its basic infrastructure.

For (II), though Socket.io and SockJS can give a unified interface among WebSocket enabled/disabled browsers, only WebSocket enabled browsers are allowed to use the system.
Thus, the connection for MapReduce algorithm flow between (I) and (II) is done via HTML5 WebSocket API.
