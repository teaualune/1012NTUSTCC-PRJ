\section{Conclusion}

This report describes a system running MapReduce model on browsers and Node.js.
The system provides a low-cost and high-scalable processing environment using HTTP server and browsers, so clients have no effort on configuration.

We implemented a server-browser MapReduce system to reduce the cost for clients setting comparing to the traditional MapReduce scenario.
Researchers can easily process large dataset with a parallel, distributed algorithm in our model.

The final result of our work is open-sourced and hosted on github:
