\section{Conclusion}

This report described a system running Mapreduce processing model on browsers and Node.js. This system provides a low-cost and high scalabile processing environment using HTTP server and browser, so clients have no dependencies installation effort.
We implemented a server-client version Mapreduce to reduce the cost for client system setting up in traditional MapReduce scenario. Researchers who cannot afford cluster can also process large data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm in our model.
